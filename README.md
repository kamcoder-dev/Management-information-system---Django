# Management-information-system---Django
Work In progress


Management information system, allowing admin users to add, delete and modify content for their integrated ecommerce site. 

Admin users will be able to monitor and control input and output variables based on the model data structure. 

The backend of the application was built using python 3.80, with Django web framework as the high-level framework. Front end was developed based on HTML, CSS, and bootstrap. 
I have created another application under the project called API, which is where I am currently creating the API based on the model data structure in order to render into a front end framework (React.js) in order to develop a full functioning e-commerce application for the client to interface. 
The ecommerce application and MIS application will operate concurrently based on the common database. 


Please create intial superuser after migrating and before running the server. 


This MIS can all the admin to create users, allocating the user to be either an admin or choosing the user to be non-active.

The admin can create a product, and generate orders based on the products and customers.
